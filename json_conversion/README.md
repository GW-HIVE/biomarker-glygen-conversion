# GlyGen to Biomarker-Partnership Sample Data Model Conversion

This repository walks through a sample conversion from the GlyGen biomarker data model to the Biomarker-Partnership data model. The example here uses the `A0001` data record from GlyGen. The `conversion.py` script is the main control flow for the conversion and the `helpers.py` file implements some of the specific data model field formatting functions. The sample GlyGen record is in the `glygen_biomarker.json` file and the sample output is the `converted_data.json` file.
